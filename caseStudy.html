                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. This app
                    provides users with access to information about movies, directors and genres. Users
                    are able to create an account, update their personal data, create a list of favorite movies,
                    look at the synopsis of each movies.
                </p>
                <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                <p>
                    mFlix was built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to
                    demonstrate my skills in full-stack JavaScript development. I was able to demonstrate
                    and practice my knowledge of front-end end back-end javascript frameworks as well as a
                    document database (MongoDB) in one project.
                </p>
                <h1>Objective</h1>
                <p>
                    The objective of the project was to have a broad full stack project I can add to my
                    professional portfolio. The task I wanted to accomplish is to build a complete
                    server-side and client-side application from scratch.

                <h1>Approach</h1>
                <h2>Server-Side</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a restful API using Node.js and Express that interacts with non-relational database
                    (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
                    To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods
                    are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format as shown on the right.
                </p>
                <P>
                    To test the API, I used Postman. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the
                    form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.
                </P>

                <h2>Client-Side</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing the API, I started to build the interface so that users can make requests to and
                    receiving reponses from the server-side. It is a single page responsive application, developed with
                    React-Angular. It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view
                    (shows a list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to
                    add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view
                    (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).

            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>
                This was one of my most challenging project. But at the same time
                this is my most favorite one since I was able to work on client-side and server-side javascript
                frameworks in one project and have a good understanding how a full-stack web development project looks
                like. I have enjoyed and learned building the API and working with database structures. I also quickly
                became familiar with using the terminal. Developing the client-side, it took me a while to understand
                how React and Angular work and how to achieve the desired results. But with the help of my great tutor
                I did accomplish this task.

            <h1>Duration</h1>
            <p>
                The development of the client-side took me longer than it normally took to complete a CareerFoundry
                achievement. Because I needed time to grasp all the content and understand how React (and
                Ract-Angular) work.
