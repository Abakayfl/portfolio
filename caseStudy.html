                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a single-page movie application called myFlix. According to the requirements that I had for
                    this project, it was
                    supposed
                    to allow to register new users, login the existing users, update their information, view movies,
                    directors and
                    genres. With the help of my tutor and long study hours, I was able to meet these requirements for
                    the
                    application.
                    To accomplish this task I used MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) stack. MongoDB is a document
                    database (to store movies and user information). Express is a Node.js web framework.
                    React is a client-side JavaScript framework. And Node.js is a JavaScript web server. After building
                    this app,
                    I replaced React with Angular.js frontend framework.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The objective is to have a full-stack project in my portfolio that I can demonstrate my exposure to
                    client-side and server-side development tools. The project brief that I received for this task
                    outlines
                    all the requirements and expectations such as having logind-view, registeration-view, movie-view,
                    update-view,
                    and so on. Here is the link for the <a href="project-brief.pdf" download target="_blank">project
                        brief</a> for detailed
                    explanations.

                <h2>Server-Side</h2>
                <p>
                    First I created the server-side of the application. To build a Rest API, I used Node.js (JavaScript
                    runtime
                    environment) and Express (to route HTTP request for the project). MondgoDB is used to construct the
                    database (to store the information the app has).
                </p>
                <P>
                    To test the API, I used Postman. The API provides information in JSON format as shown on the right.
                    While testing the API endpoints, I used CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations.
                    . At the end, the application is deployed to Heroku (a cloud platform as a server) to host it.

                </P>

        <div class="client-side">
            <div class="client-content">
                <h2>Client-Side</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing the API and the database, I worked on the client-side (front-end) of the app where
                    users can make requests and recieve responses from the server. I used Bootstrap and UI libraries
                    to make the app visually appealing and responsive. It is a single page responsive application,
                    developed with
                    React Redux (for global accessibility). It provides several interface views such as a main view
                    (shows a list of all movies),
                    single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list
                    of favorites), a login view, a registration view and a profile view
                    (where users can update their user data and list of favorites). These views are interacting with the
                    REST API endpoints defined in the server-side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After hosting the app in Heroku, React is replaced with Angular for several advantages such as
                    cross-platform
                    development, scalability, build speed and high performance. TypeScript programming language is used
                    while working with Angular.

            <h1>Challenges and How I resolved them</h1>
            <p>
                This application was one of most favorite projects in the course. It was also the one I challenged most.
                It took so much longer than what I expected. I needed to request help from my tutor, post questions on
                the course developer's slack channel and utilize online resources to see how other developers fix the
                problemns that I have encountered. Also I used Chrome developer tools (expecially breakpoint)
                several times for debugging.

                I am glad that I have worked on this project since it gave an understanding of how server-side and
                client-side
                work together in a full-stack project. And the challenges along the way, I believe, sharpened my skills
                and
                broadaned my perspective.
